Process Flow

Data Preparation:
  Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and distribution.
  Address class imbalance in the target variable to improve model accuracy and performance.

Data Analysis and Feature Selection:
   Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and insights in transaction data.
   Select important features influencing the likelihood of fraud while excluding non-predictive variables (e.g., transaction ID).

Model Building:
   Implement and compare multiple classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
   Use GridSearchCV for tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
   Evaluate models with metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to select the best-performing model.

Results & Insights
   Highlight the performance of the best model with respect to fraud detection.
   Visualize feature importance and relationships using Partial Dependence Plots to understand key factors influencing fraudulent behavior.

Conclusion
  This project demonstrates a systematic approach to detecting fraudulent transactions through machine learning. By applying advanced algorithms and tuning them for optimal performance, the final model achieved significant improvement in detection metrics, achieving a 75% F1 score and a 65% accuracy, compared to a baseline of 45%. This enhancement not only supports the identification and mitigation of fraudulent activity but also strengthens trust in financial transaction systems by reducing false positives and accurately identifying fraud.
